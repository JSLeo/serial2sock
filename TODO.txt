1. Rename Com0com Redirector to something more pretty
2. Better architect the program control logic so that
   it doesn't hang when waiting for input.
3. Eliminate the second COM port and post own com0com
   code. 
4. Change all references to COM PORT B to the first
5. Have async callbacks communicate with that port
   in such a way that they do not occupy the port... that
   is the trick for sockets anyway.
6. Alternatively (from the above three), keep the second
   COM port but keep it proprietary. Ensure that it all
   works even if the second COM port isn't prefixed
   CMC-.
